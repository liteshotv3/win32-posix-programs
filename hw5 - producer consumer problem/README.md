<h2>Homework 5 - Producer-Consumer Problem</h2>
Due by 7:00 p.m. Wednesday, 4/15/15<br>
<p>
Part 1<br>
Update the code you submitted for homework 4 to use a one-dimensional global array to hold all of the
character counts, so that all the threads increment the same array entries without using any
synchronization. Then create a second version that protects the increment of the global array using a
mutex. Run both versions on the same file and compare the character counts. Which are larger? Why?

Part 2<br>
Implement a multi-threaded producer-consumer program using a bounded buffer. Use full and
empty semaphores to keep track of the numbers of full and empty slots available to the consumers and
producers, respectively. Use a mutex to coordinate access to the buffer (once the thread determines that
there is an available slot via the appropriate semaphore). The buffer should have 16 slots total. The
number of producers, the number of consumers, and the number of items each producer produces
should be specified by their binary log as command-line parameters. Thus, the following command
should generate 8 producers, 16 consumers, and 64 items produced by each producer:<br>
./producer-consumer 3 4 6<br>
The consumers need to each consume the same number of items before exiting. Your code should
calculate the number of items each consumer needs to consume so that every item produced gets
consumed. The main thread should parse all of the command-line parameters, print them in a message,
initialize the synchronization objects, spawn all of the threads, wait for them to complete, and then
print a final message. The items produced by the producer threads should be integers, obtained using
the following expression:<br>
thread_number * num_produced + counter<br>
where thread_number is an integer passed to each thread ranging from 0 to num_threads - 1,
num_produced is the number of items produced by each producer, and counter is a local variable
in each thread that gets initialized to 0 and incremented every time a new item is produced. The
consumer threads should consume these items by simply printing them. (Printing is the only required
"consumption".)</p>
<p>
Use the same functions listed in homework 4 for thread creation and management. Use
pthread_mutex_init, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock, sem_init,
sem_wait and sem_post for synchronization in POSIX. Use CreateSemaphore,
WaitForSingleObject and ReleaseSemaphore for synchronization in Win32.
You should submit your source code files (one for each platform) and a short writeup in pdf format that
includes a description of what you did and the compilation and execution output from each of your
programs. For part 1, briefly discuss the difference, if any, between the counts produced with and
without synchronization. (If you donâ€™t see a difference, try using a larger input file.) For part 2, test
your code with 1 producer and 2 consumers, 2 producers and 1 consumer, 2 producers and 4
consumers, and 4 consumers and 2 producers, each time with the producers producing 32 items each.
Submit everything (including the writeup) to the regular submission link on iLearn, and then submit
just the writeup to the TurnItIn link to generate an originality report.
