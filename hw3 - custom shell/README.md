<h2>Homework 3 - Simple Shell</h2>
Due by 7:00 p.m. Wednesday, 3/11/15<br>
<p>
For this assignment you will implement your own shell that runs on top of the regular command-line
interpreters for Linux and Windows. Your shell should read lines of user input into a 1024 byte buffer,
then parse and execute the commands by forking/creating new processes. Write both a POSIX version
of your shell that calls fork() followed by execlp(), and a Win32 version that calls
CreateProcess(). Following each command, your shell should wait for its child process to
complete, and then reprint the command prompt. The user should be able to specify the command to
execute by giving a path to the executable file (e.g. ./hw1) or by using path expansion to locate the
executable file (i.e. searching each directory in the PATH environment variable). (Note that the
execlp() and CreateProcess() functions perform this processing automically; you do not need
to program it yourself.)
</p>
<p>
Before your POSIX version calls execlp(), it should parse the input string and separate it into a
collection of substrings representing the executable file and any command-line arguments. It should
then call execlp() with these substrings as arguments. (Note that the number of command-line
arguments is variable; to handle this your code may select among various execlp() call statements
with different numbers of arguments.) Your code must handle up to three command-line arguments (not
including the executable file itself). In the Win32 version, you should be able to pass the unparsed input
string directly to CreateProcess(). For both versions, if the user enters the exit command, your
shell should terminate (returning to the regular shell).

Here is a sample execution on a Linux machine:<br>
Myshell> ls<br>
file1 file2 file3<br>
Myshell> ls l<br>
total 3<br>
rwxrxrx<br>
1 cassidy None 2883 Nov 5 12:57 file1<br>
rwxrxrx<br>
1 cassidy None 1468 Oct 23 14:07 file2<br>
rwxrxrx<br>
1 cassidy None 200 Jan 24 2013 file3<br>
Myshell> /usr/bin/echo this<br>
this<br>
Myshell> exit<br>
<p>
You should submit your source code files (one for each platform) and a short writeup in pdf format that
includes a description of what you did and the compilation and execution output from each of your
programs. Your executation output should include commands with command-line arguments. Then use
the exit command to exit your program and show the output of the same commands in the regular
command-line interpreter for that machine to ensure they match. Submit everything to the regular
submission link on iLearn, and then submit just the writeup to the TurnItIn link to generate an
originality report.
